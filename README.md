# turbojet

Led the design and modeling of a turbojet engine project using SolidWorks, encompassing key components such as propeller blades, the main shaft, and the outer housing. Created detailed 3D models of each part, focusing on precise geometrical accuracy and integration for effective assembly. Implemented advanced simulation techniques to evaluate aerodynamic performance, thermal stresses, and structural integrity. Optimized component designs to enhance efficiency and manufacturability, ensuring the engine met performance criteria. Conducted thorough analysis and testing to validate the functionality of the assembled engine. Documented the design process and results, providing comprehensive engineering drawings and presentations. This project demonstrated advanced skills in CAD modeling, engineering analysis, and practical application of mechanical engineering principles.
